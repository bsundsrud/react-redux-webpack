# react-redux-webpack

Template project created so I could learn how to get all the pieces working together with a Webpack config that would result
in an optimally-sized production build.

## Development

Install node modules with `npm install`.

* `npm run dev` starts a `webpack-dev-server` with hot module replacement inlined.
* `npm run build` runs a production webpack build that optimizes and uglifies the code, placing the output in `dist/`.
